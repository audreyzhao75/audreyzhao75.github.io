                <h1>TritonHacks</h1>
                <p>Participated December 2020 - May 2022</p>
                <p class="top50">TritonHacks is a <b>high school hackathon</b> run by UCSD students centered around providing resources for participants to pursue their interests in STEM-related fields. 
                    I joined the student org in 2020 to help them prepare for their first and second-ever hackathon. 
                    I was part of their content creation and design team during the preparation period and a  tutor/mentor/staff during the events.</p>
                <p>Content creation was focused on creating starter kits, which were 2-3 hour long tutorials for the students to learn certain subjects. 
                    The design team was focused on creating the design system, merch, website design, and other design-related tasks needed for the event. 
                    Tutors helped students with their projects and solving starter kits, mentors guided ideas and conducted check-ins with their teams, and staff managed the volunteers, food, and parking of the in-person event.</p>

                <h1>2021</h1>
                <p>TritonHacks held their first-ever hackathon on the weekend of June 26-27, 2021. However, because of COVID-19, the event was held online on Discord, Notion, and Gather.town.</p>
                <h5 class="top50">Content Creation - Data Science</h5>
                <p>For 5 months, I helped create a data science starter kit that guides students on how to analyze 2016 US primary election data and uncover sociological, geographical, 
                    and economic voting patterns through Deepnote (a notebook environment) and Python packages. You can view our kit <a href="https://deepnote.com/workspace/david-laub-387ae28a-5038-47dc-84c1-c0c1dfb998a2/project/TritonHacks-DS-Starter-Kit-3af3804d-7fd6-4411-ab61-13b39af482c5/%2F0%20Welcome.ipynb">here</a> (however, you need to be signed in to Deepnote).</p>
                <h5 class="top50">Design Team</h5>
                <p>As a member of the design team, I assisted in creating the designs (shown below!) of the theme, website, and merchandise for the TritonHacks 2021 event. </p>
                <h5 class="top50">Mentor & Tutor</h5>
                <p>During the event, I periodically checked-in with my assigned teams and tutored them on the data track, which included the web scraping and data visualization (which I helped make!) starter kits.</p>

                <h1>2022</h1>
                <p>During the 2021-2022 academic year, many students were able to return to in-person classes and events. Therefore, for the second-ever TritonHacks event, 
                    we planned for an in-person hackathon on the UCSD campus in the CSE Basement. </p>
                <h5 class="top50">Design Co-Lead</h5>
                <p>I became a design lead for 5-6 designers, where we focused on creating new designs for the theme, website, and merchandise for the TritonHacks 2022 event. 
                    Below are some official designs  that I personally created or collaborated on, but there are many other great designs from the other designers.</p>

                <h5 class="top50">Volunteer Coordinator / Mentor</h5>
                <p>During the weekend of the event, I handled the volunteer scheduling. I also checked-in and distributed merchandise to volunteers and students. While the students were “hacking”, I mentored a few teams on any questions or ideation help.</p>

                <h1>Final Thoughts</h1>
                <p>These two years with the TritonHacks team has been an unforgettable experience, where I’ve met so many hard-working and creative people. I’ve learned a lot about designing and developing from my team members, and I’m so glad that the events were successes. I hope to continue seeing it succeed and even helping TritonHacks as an alumni!</p>
