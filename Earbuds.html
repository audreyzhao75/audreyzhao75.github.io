                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>For our final project in our class DSGN 1: Design of Everyday Things, we chose to study and redesign wired earbuds as they belong to a 
                    category of ubiquitous products: devices that are used to privately listen to audio. As such, there are many variations as different designers have 
                    focused on various aspects, enhancing one over another. While there is so much variety and no design is perfect, our group of six students were curious about 
                    improving the basic wired earbud design in order to best suit student life. </p>
                <p>In this project, we focused more on the responses of the interviewees, so the datacollecting procedure is described below.</p>

                <h1>The Process</h1>

                <!-- S1 -->
                <h3>Data collecting procedure:</h3>
                <p>We sought out users who were visibly using wired earbuds in the places that people could be commonly found studying. The interviews took place in four main 
                    areas on the UCSD campus: Geisel, Middle of Muir, Muir Quad, and Pines/Roots. </p>
                <p>Before beginning the main part of the interview, we asked for demographic information. As a whole, our interview pool consisted of current UCSD undergraduates, 
                    ranging from 1st to 5th years. There were a total of 18 interviewees. We split the main interview into two portions. </p>
                <a id="datasheetLink" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vrLRqxhqHc1r5hyGuk9X1aNZPj1MSWkxXFgKWMsPHyo/edit#gid=1801604049" target="_blank">Click here to view the datasheet</a>
                <h5>Part 1: Questions</h5>
                <p>The first part of the interview was the pre-task questions where we simply asked for information verbally on their thoughts and feelings about various parts of the product. 
                    This included the settings and contexts in which they used their device, their opinions on their pair (including pros and cons), and comparable products that they had in the past. 
                    We purposely asked open-ended questions so as to not limit the user. </p>
                <p>Below is the order of the questions paired with the rationale:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>What kind or brand of wired earbuds do you have?
                        <ul><li>We asked this question to scope out the range of common earbud models, as well as collect data on the specific model of earbud.</li></ul></li>
                    <li>When and what do you use it for?
                        <ul><li>We ask this question to collect qualitative data on the settings and contexts in which users use the product. For example, a user using earbuds while, say, cooking in the 
                            kitchen (which requires lots of movement) may experience a different set of pain points than a user studying in the library. </li></ul></li>
                    <li>Have you had other types of earbuds in the past or multiple (e.g.: headphones, airpods, etc).
                        <ul><li>This question serves as an introduction to the next question.</li></ul></li>
                    <li>What are your thoughts on those compared to your current pair? What are the pros and cons to your current pair compared to your other pairs?
                        <ul><li>The aim of this question is to provoke thought about the particular pros and cons of the user’s individual pair of earbuds (compared to any other current or past pairs) 
                            without creating a leading question. Through this prompt, the user may start a conversation about the trade-offs that grab their attention. </li></ul></li>
                    <li> What are your thoughts on the wire of the earbuds?
                        <ul><li>We ask this question to collect qualitative data on the user’s overall experience with regards to the wire. We speculate user opinions on the wire are plentiful, 
                            based on prior interaction with the wired earbud product ourselves. </li></ul></li>
                    <li>Do you ever lose your earbuds? What happened to them and why?
                        <ul><li>We ask this question to determine frequency of earbud displacement, as well as factors that lead to that displacement.</li></ul></li>
                    <li> How long do your earbuds usually last?
                        <ul><li>We ask this question to determine earbud durability, potentially discovering pain points that lead to early damage. </li></ul></li>
                    <li>How much did it cost? Was it complimentary or bought?
                        <ul><li>We ask this question to collect qualitative and quantitative data on how much money users are willing to trade off for quality of earbuds. </li></ul></li>
                    <li>What are your thoughts on volume?
                        <ul><li>We ask this question to determine whether users experience complaints with regards to volume (e.g. video B having lower volume than video A, leading to hearing damage if not adjusted correctly). </li></ul></li>
                    <li> Is there any reason why you use wired earbuds?
                        <ul><li>An endless variety of alternative audio devices exist. We ask this question to determine the common reasons why users use wired earbuds instead. </li></ul></li>
                    <li>Any last thoughts before performing tasks? Things you like, things you dislike about your earbuds?
                        <ul><li>We ask this question to provide the user an opportunity to voice any last opinions and experiences we had not considered when writing interview questions. </li></ul></li>
                </ol>

                <h5>Part 2: Tasks</h5>
                <p>For the second part of the interview, we asked them to do various common tasks with their earbuds and watched how they acted in addition to listening to what they talked about in the process. 
                    We used the Master-Apprentice Model by giving them a general task to do and asking how they personally would go about doing it, not specifying that they perform it in a certain way. 
                    This ensured that our own ways of performing these tasks would not interfere with how users in general go about doing them. The information we wanted to gain was a better understanding of the 
                    common issues that the users had. We had our own issues and problems that came up, but there was no way to know if that was reflective of the entire subsample. </p>
                <p>Below is the order of the tasks paired with the rationale:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Can you demonstrate how you would use them? 
                        <ul><li>This is the first of the set of task oriented questions. The goal of this question is to observe the entire workflow that users experience when using this product: from removing the earbuds from storage, 
                            to disentangling the wire, to inserting the buds into their ear, to plugging the earbuds into their device, etc. </li></ul></li>
                    <li>When you’re going to classes, do you use your earbuds? Do you walk, bike? Can you demonstrate how you use your earbuds when moving? And where do you keep it most of the time?                        
                        <ul><li>The goal of this question is to observe the user’s interactions with the product when they are in motion, a common scenario that occurs when users are moving from point A 
                            to point B across campus or exercising outdoors. We note where the user stores their phone and earbuds, whether in their pockets, in their hands, or in their bags. We also take note of dangling wires. </li></ul></li>
                    <li>You have your earbuds in. Pretend I’m your friend and I’m approaching you to talk. Demonstrate a conversation with me. 
                        <ul><li>Earbuds commonly obstruct conversation. Therefore we present this task to observe whether the user removes both earbuds, removes a single earbud, or keeps the earbuds in when approached for a chat.</li></ul></li>
                    <li>Can you demonstrate how you store your earbuds? How do you take them out?
                        <ul><li>The goal of this task is to observe the user’s storage method. We take note of whether or not the user wraps their wire around a device, rolls the wire up, folds it, or leaves it as is. We also note the pockets in which users store their product.</li></ul></li>
                    <li>If you have a remote, do you use it? When do you use it? Please demonstrate how you would use it. 
                        <ul><li>The goal of this task is to observe whether the remote is a commonly used feature, and whether or not users confront pain points when interacting with this small remote that is not within their line of sight. </li></ul></li>
                    <li>How would you lower the volume, or play/pause with your remote?
                        <ul><li>Again, the goal of this task is to observe whether or not users confront pain points when interacting with the remote, which is small in size and frequently interacted with via touch, not sight. </li></ul></li>
                    <li>Demonstrate your cleaning process.
                        <ul><li>Because earbuds contact bodily substances, and because the small surface area of the earbud does not afford easy cleaning, we speculate this process may generate pain points. 
                            Users with removable rubber earbud tips may also experience a different cleaning process than those without removable tips.</li></ul></li>
                    <li>Demonstrate plugging in your earbuds to your device, listening to a song, and unplugging them. [if they don’t do it above]                        
                        <ul><li>The goal of this task is to observe the plugging and unplugging process. Users may not always be aware that audio automatically pauses upon earbud removal, or they may have to adjust the audio volume upon earbud insertion. </li></ul></li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Problems and Trends</h3>
                <p>Here we observe trends and patterns in the responses and actions of our 18 interviewees.</p>
                
                <h5>1.) The Positives and Negatives of the Wire</h5>
                <p>We observed various responses here on the opinions of the wire, namely in questions 4, 5, 6, and 10 and tasks 1, 2, and 4. We had both positive and negative opinions on the wire of their earbuds. 
                    The breakdown of the opinions are in the charts and analyses below.</p>
                <img src="earbudsImages/fig1.png" class="fig">
                <p class="figDesc">Figure 1.0: Chart showing the number of interviewees emphasizing a positive or negative quality</p>
                <p>In Figure 1.0, we gathered the number of people who specifically mentioned a positive or negative quality in interview question 5. We defined a positive quality when the interviewee said they liked an aspect of the wire. We defined a negative aspect to 
                    be a quality that an interviewee specified that they disliked. There were 17 people out of 18 interviewees that had some sort of opinion about the wire. The 1 interviewee specified that they were neutral and had no opinion on them or their qualities, 
                    so we did not include them in these charts. </p>

                <img src="earbudsImages/fig1.1.png" class="fig">
                <p class="figDesc">Figure 1.1: Chart showing the explanations to the positive quality responses</p>
                <p>In Figure 1.1, we gathered the number of people who specifically mentioned a positive or negative quality in interview question 5. Six users explained that they liked how the long wire made the earbuds easier to see and thus afforded better retainment. 
                    One user liked how sometimes, their earbuds would save their phone from hitting the ground if they accidentally dropped them. </p>

                <img src="earbudsImages/fig1.2.png" class="fig">
                <p class="figDesc">Figure 1.2: Chart showing the explanations to the negative quality responses</p>
                <p>Figure 1.2 shows reasons as to why the interviewees disliked the wire. Six users complained about the cable afforded entanglement when taking the earbuds out from where they were stored. The other four users mentioned an issue involving the physical 
                    constraints imposed by the wire from getting caught on various objects to inhibiting various movements.</p>

                <p>The main benefits of the wire was that the visibility afforded users to better keep track of their belongings while the main drawback was that they get tangled in storage. These qualities are somewhat at odds with each other because the bigger amount 
                    of space the earbuds take up, the easier they are to see. But if the wire is made longer, then more tangles will result. The varying complaints and praises of the suggests the need for a design with greater flexibility and less chance of entanglement. </p>

                <h5>2.) Storage</h5>
                <p>We found that 9 of the 18 interviewees simply stuff their wired earbuds into their pockets and have to untangle their earbuds each time. In the previous section, we briefly mentioned tangling from wire storage as a negative quality for some interviewees, 
                    but other interviewees did not always have this issue. We found that 6 interviewees specified their method of storing to avoid tangling. Some users recognized that the cable afforded wrapping around various objects, while others decided on having a 
                    designated case to store them. In either situation, users utilized declarative knowledge and understood that changing the shape of the cables allowed for more convenient storage. We observed that these specified methods reduced the time spent on setting 
                    up or untangling the earbuds.</p>
                <p>Looking more closely at how users wrapped their wires specifically or otherwise stored them, there were 6 different ways of storing: folding in half, wrapping around their hands, wrapping around their phone, using an external case, leaving them in their laptop, 
                    or no organization. All in all, because of the large amount of different ways users would store their earbuds, there seems to be no intuitive way to store them indicated by any signifier.</p>
                <p>One user, interviewee 7, mentioned that they preferred wires that were flatter and cased in a smoother material. They explained that these factors could help in the wires having a lower rate of tangle. </p>

                <h5>3.) Durability</h5>
                <p>We found a varied set of responses from users regarding the durability of the earbuds. While a significant portion of this variability can be attributed to the different brands of earbuds our users possessed, we found that 13 out of 18 of our interviewee’s 
                    earbuds lasted a year or less. 4 of our interviewees complained that their earbuds broke in a matter of months. 9 of our interviewees stated that their earbuds lasted for approximately a year. Only 3 users claimed that their earbuds had lasted more than 3 years, 
                    and all 3 of those users mentioned that their earbuds were not entirely functional in some way. One interviewee noted that an additional component needed to enable her earbuds, the Apple Earbud dongle, proved to be an even greater weak spot, as she was forced 
                    to replace the dongle several times.</p>
                <p>We also found a varying set of causes for the breaking down of these earbuds. One user claimed that the earbuds broke because various slips she made, such as forgetting she was wearing the earbuds, would result in her pulling on the wire repeatedly: a memory-lapse slip. 
                    Another user mentioned forgetting the earbuds in her pocket and then accidentally putting them in the washer, another memory-lapse slip. Five users mentioned that the wire would start breaking at various points over time. These 5 users described how the earbuds would 
                    break apart one section at a time, usually resulting in one side of the earbuds breaking before the other side. </p>
                <p>We speculate that the constant tangling of the wires causes the user to perform an action-based slip and unintentionally stress the wires by repeatedly pulling the wires apart in their attempt to untangle the earbuds. Additionally, the various memory-lapse slips 
                    performed by users may also put undue stress on the wires. This may eventually result in the wire’s material fraying or may cause the electrical components to cease functioning. As such, reducing the chance of the wires tangling would in turn prolong the durability 
                    of the earbuds. However, while reducing tangling is necessary, we should also try to increase visibility to help prevent the various memory-lapse slips performed by users. It would also be ideal to waterproof the earbuds, but that may prove to be more difficult 
                    as well as expensive. However, one way to reduce tangling, maintain or increase visibility, and improve overall durability is to increase the thickness of the cable.</p>

                        <h6>Chance of Entanglement vs Chance of Displacement</h6>
                        <p>“Entanglement” refers to the chances of the wire getting tangled. “Displacement” refers to the chances of the user losing the earbuds. 
                            Wired earbuds, if not carefully stored in backpacks/purses/pockets, etc, will naturally fall into entropy, tangling themselves into knots. 
                            This trait does not afford the user ease of storage. Entanglement is an inconvenience that not only slowly damages the wire itself, 
                            but also comes at a time-cost to the user, whether they are attempting to disentangle the wire before use, or cleanly store the earbuds after use. 
                            If the earbuds are stored among other wired devices (chargers, other earbuds, etc), the result is a wire jungle in which all strings of wires are intertwined.</p>
                        <p>Out of our 18 participants, 6 had complaints about wire entanglement (Figure 1.2).
                            One solution to entanglement would be to simply eliminate the wire, as featured in wireless earbuds. However, earbuds in isolation are small in size. 
                            While these small spatial dimensions afford users to snugly fit the earbuds into the contours of their ear, without the wire tethering them to a larger object, 
                            the small dimensions also increase the probability of displacement. As a result, despite this inconvenience of entanglement, users still preferred earbuds with 
                            wires than without. Out of 18 participants, 6 appreciated the wire for increasing the earbud’s visibility, and therefore affording better trackability (Figure 1.1 from earlier).</p>
                        <p>The ideal design minimizes both chances of entanglement and displacement, as neither qualities are desirable. By providing a solution for entanglement without removing the wire, 
                            our redesign retains the visibility of the earbuds while accounting for the inconvenience of entanglement. </p>

                            Due to the wide variety of earbuds in the market, users can choose to purchase a kind with traits and cost that they value more. However, lower selling prices often correspond 
                            with lower quality materials in the production of the earbud, as manufacturers can not afford to buy more expensive, higher quality materials with low profit returns. As a result, 
                            the earbud’s material may not last very long, thus forcing the user to buy another pair eventually. This tradeoff may be good for business, but it hurts the user financially in the long term. </p>
                        <p>Wired earbuds are not as durable as their competitors due to the nature of the wire. It can easily get caught onto objects, the stress of which decreases their lifespan. 
                            It is also prone to fraying,  revealing the electrical wire inside. 6 out of the 18 interviewees mentioned that their previous earbuds broke in this manner, 
                            resulting in them getting another pair. A broken earbud does not afford good sound quality which completely negates the whole function of the earbud. </p>
                        <p>An ideal design would be both durable and cheap. This would mean that the wired earbud redesign would need to incorporate a way for the earbud to not catch onto things and fray.</p>

                <h1>Redesign: Foldable Spindle</h1>
                <p>First, we will discuss the design as a whole and then focus on the justification and trade-offs for each specific feature.</p>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col">

                        <p class="figDesc">Figure 3.0: The process of storing earbuds with our redesign</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col">
                        <h5>General Design</h5>
                        <p>Our redesign features the addition of a soft, foldable spindle flap located at the base of the wire. We focused on different methods for wire storage 
                            in order to address the main issue of wire entanglement in storage, while retaining wire visibility. </p>
                        <p>When users have their earbuds in their ears listening to audio, the spindle will remain folded up at the base as in step 1 of Figure 3.0.</p>
                        <p>When they are ready to store them, they will unfold the spindle flap as well as the rectangular flap as in step 2.</p>
                        <p>Next, they will wrap the wire around the spindle, rotating the hinge where the wire meets the spindle so as to reduce stress on the wire. In addition, 
                            they will rotate the jack inwards, again using the hinge. This is shown in step 3.</p>
                        <p>Then, in step 4, they will take the entire spindle flap and fold it towards the center.</p>
                        <p>Finally, in step 5, they will fold the rectangular flap over the spindle slap, securing it magnetically.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>As previously stated, simply having the wire affords at least 6 different ways for users to store their earbuds. Even when users fold or wrap the wire in a certain way, 
                    the string still often entangles without an external product to secure it in place. Therefore, introducing a component onto the earbuds which affords keeping the wires 
                    in place while in storage would serve the same purpose as having an external product, but would be even more convenient as they cannot be separated.</p>
                <p>This design requires some effort from the user if they are to use it properly unlike the design of airpods or tethering wires. However, the increased size also increases 
                    visibility which is a positive, as users will be less likely to lose these earbuds. In addition, it is cheaper to implement this solution which requires more physical parts, 
                    but not more technological ones. Furthermore, the bulkiness and covering increases its durability. </p>
                <h5>1.) Spindle Component</h5>
                <img src="earbudsImages/spindleComp.png" class="fig">
                <p>This component was inspired by spindles that ordinarily afford wrapping string around it. As our design draws from a similar one in a different context, users already have the 
                    correct mental model of what a spindle does, making it easier for them to bridge the gulf of execution; the indentations signify and afford wrapping a string-like object around it.</p>
                <p>The spindle isn’t the exact shape as a typical one however as the wires wrap around the wider section rather than the thinner one as in Figure 3.12 versus Figures 3.10 and 3.11. 
                    It looks more similar to Figure 3.11 as they are both flatter and wider than Figure 3.10. However, Figure 3.10 is the more typical design of a spindle. This may reduce understandability 
                    as their mental model of the soft, foldable spindle may not reference that of a typical spindle. </p>
                <p>However, the flatter and wider shape of the foldable spindle also reduces its size, affording it to be stored flat in a pocket or near a smartphone which is what all users do. 
                    Having it be too cylindrical will not afford being stored in the same way as it will result in pockets bulging and difficulty holding with a smartphone. In addition, the wider 
                    spindle affords the wire to be stored with less rotations around the spindle. This decreases the amount of time users have to spend wrapping and unwrapping as well as increases 
                    the longevity of the wire by reducing stress put on it by wrapping. </p>
                <h5>2.) Magnetic Closure Flaps</h5>
                <img src="earbudsImages/magCloFlaps.png" class="fig">
                <p>Having the extra rectangular flap provides extra reinforcement, increasing the durability as well as keeping the wires securely in place. In addition, the flat magnetic bar that would connect 
                    with the edge of the spindle flap will also keep the wires in place. The subtle click and pressure of the magnets connecting will provide feedback to the user that their earbuds are properly 
                    wrapped up, allowing them to bridge the gulf of evaluation.</p>
                <p>When both flaps are open, the product is an awkward, floppy shape that is difficult to store (see step 1 of Figure 3.2). However, this will encourage users to use the product properly, 
                    as it provides a physical constraint.The flaps moving where they fold will make it easier to bridge the gulf of execution as it signifies where the flaps can be folded and maneuvered around. 
                    Having more flaps increases the number of steps that users have to go through in order to bridge the gulf of execution. However, folding it repeatedly is not substantially more difficult 
                    than folding it once, and the benefit of increased durability and decreased entanglement is worth the small amount of effort on the users’ part. </p>
                <h5>3.) Rotating Jack</h5>
                <img src="earbudsImages/rotatingJack.png" class="fig">
                <p>For the components of the wire that connect directly to the spindle, as they are the most prone to fraying, our design reinforces them with harder, plastic pieces that rotate instead of the soft, 
                    bendy wire (Figure 3.3). This design contributes to the durability of the product as well as the integrity of the shape, making it more convenient to store and less likely to be bent out of shape.</p>
                <p>Having to manufacture more parts will be costlier and the increased price will eventually trickle down to the consumer. In addition, it may also make it slightly heavier and less convenient to carry around. 
                    However, it is still more cost-effective to pay a little more for a sturdier product than to continuously buy the same cheaper product over and over again because it breaks.</p>
                <h5>Additional Features: Flat Cable</h5>
                <img src="earbudsImages/cyl_flat.png" id="flatcyl">
                <p>Many wired earbuds (e.g.: apple earbuds) feature a cylindrical cable with a circular cross section, whose lack of hard edges encourage entanglement. We propose the addition of a thicker, flat cable (Figure 3.4). 
                    The dimensions of this redesigned cable would deter entanglement through (1) reduced flexibility, due to greater thickness, and (2) straight edges, which limit the directions the wire may bend: a physical constraint. 
                    Trade-offs of this feature include: (1) increased cable material, which may lead to slightly higher costs, and (2) greater difficulty wrapping the wire around the spindle. </p>
                <h5>Additional Features: Cable reinforcements</h5>
                <p>Several users complained of wire damage at points subject to frequent bending (i.e. the connection between the wire and the jack), leading to premature product failure. We propose the addition of hard reinforcements 
                    at these stress points in the wire. Trade-offs of this feature include (1) increased material, which may lead to slightly higher costs, and (2) increased difficulty wrapping the wire due to harder, more inflexible pieces. </p>
                <p>Additionally, we also propose increasing the overall thickness of the cable. The thicker cables cause the cable to naturally unfold, thus lessening the likeliness of entanglement while increasing both overall durability and 
                    visibility of the cables. Unfortunately some trade-offs of this would include: (1) increased prices as a result of more cable material, and (2) slightly more difficulty in wrapping the cable since the cable more naturally unfolds.</p>
                <h3>Process: Redesign Prototypes and Iteration</h3>
                <p>We started our redesign process by meeting together in person, each writing ideas that we liked on sticky notes individually, then making a list of them altogether. Our list was organized by identifying a couple of problems that we 
                    noticed during interviews such as tangling and breaking, then putting our redesign features underneath the idea (Figure 4.0) We took inspiration from designs that we liked from other products, hoping to build off of the best parts 
                    while mitigating their drawbacks. After coming up with as many ideas as we could, we then narrowed them down by discussing the trade-offs.</p>
                <img src="earbudsImages/iter1.png" class="fig">
                <p>The animal charger idea was cute and reinforced the wire at the jack (Figure 4.0). However, it was also bulky and if it was attached to the earbuds, was non-customizable and may be awkward to carry around. Some smaller ideas were 
                    integrated into the additional features of our redesign if they were compatible with our main one. Some of these include having magnets and a thicker cable (Figure 4.0).</p>
                <p>The main idea of using a spindle was inspired by spindles for yarn. We made a paper prototype by wrapping up a sticky note and then wrapping earbuds around it (Figure 4.1). However, this initial idea was a strange, 
                    round shape that, even though it resembled a spindle more, would make it awkward if it were connected to the base of the wire. In addition, the wires would also be exposed and wrapped around a large amount of 
                    times which would stress out the wire. </p>
                <img src="earbudsImages/iter2.png" class="fig">
                <p>Our next iteration addressed these issues by having a flatter, more rectangular shape, where the wire would be wrapped around the long edge (Figure 4.2)  Because we used paper to make it, we noticed that we could have additional 
                    flaps that folded over the wire, covering them up so that they would be better protected in addition to providing reinforcement to the structure. In addition, the sticky part of the sticky note inspired us to think of a way to better 
                    hold it in place rather than having hanging flaps which is where the idea of having magnetic closures came from. (Figure 4.3)</p>
                <h1>Conclusion and Next-Steps</h1>
                <p>Through our observations and interviews, our main finding was that the most prominent issue with wired earbuds was the excess tangling in storage. Our redesign takes into account this fact while also considering that there are still 
                    positive qualities about the wire. As such, the redesign keeps the wire while also providing an effective way of storing them such that they will not get tangled. This preserves the positive quality of heightened visibility that is 
                    important for users to keep track of their belongings. </p>
                <p>If given more time and resources to continue working, we would do more user research on whether users would be willing to put in the extra effort of wrapping their earbuds in order to keep them tidy or if our redesign needs to make 
                    the process even easier. We would use the Master-Apprentice model to observe the users directly in the act of wrapping their earbuds and determine from there whether or not changes needed to be made.</p>
                <p>In addition, we would create a physical prototype of our foldable spindle and ask users what they thought about it. Is it intuitive that the wires wrap around the spindle? Does it affect the experience of using earbuds in any way? 
                    Can the user cross the gulf of execution by interpreting the signifiers given by our prototype? We would then have a variety of users test out our prototype to make sure that it can be used by as many people as possible. 
                    Then, we would take our findings and iterate over again, repeating the process until we find a product that will be easily used by everyone.</p>
